<p>Following table shows all the relational operators supported by C language. Assume variable <b>A</b> holds 10 and variable <b>B</b> holds 20 then:</p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:10%">Operator</th><th style="width:55%;">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>==</td><td> Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A == B) is not true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>!=</td><td> Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A != B) is true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;</td><td> Checks if the value of left  operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &gt; B) is not true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;</td><td> Checks if the value of left  operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &lt; B) is true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;=</td><td> Checks if the value of left  operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &gt;= B) is not true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;=</td><td> Checks if the value of left  operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &lt;= B) is true. </td></tr>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Try the following example to understand all the relational  operators available in C programming language:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
   int a = 21;
   int b = 10;
   int c ;

   if( a == b )
   {
      printf("Line 1 - a is equal to b\n" );
   }
   else
   {
      printf("Line 1 - a is not equal to b\n" );
   }
   if ( a &lt; b )
   {
      printf("Line 2 - a is less than b\n" );
   }
   else
   {
      printf("Line 2 - a is not less than b\n" );
   }
   if ( a &gt; b )
   {
      printf("Line 3 - a is greater than b\n" );
   }
   else
   {
      printf("Line 3 - a is not greater than b\n" );
   }
   /* Lets change value of a and b */
   a = 5;
   b = 20;
   if ( a &lt;= b )
   {
      printf("Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to  b\n" );
   }
   if ( b &gt;= a )
   {
      printf("Line 5 - b is either greater than  or equal to b\n" );
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When you compile and execute the above program it produces the following result:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
Line 1 - a is not equal to b
Line 2 - a is not less than b
Line 3 - a is greater than b
Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to  b
Line 5 - b is either greater than  or equal to b
</pre></td></tr></table>
