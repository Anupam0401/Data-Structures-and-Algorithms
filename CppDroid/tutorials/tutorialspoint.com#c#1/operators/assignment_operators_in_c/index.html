<p>There are following assignment operators supported by C language:</p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:10%">Operator</th><th style="width:55%;">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>=</td><td>Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand</td><td> C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C</td></tr>
<tr><td>+=</td><td>Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td><td> C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td></tr>
<tr><td>-=</td><td>Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td><td> C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td></tr>
<tr><td>*=</td><td>Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td><td> C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td></tr>
<tr><td>/=</td><td>Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand</td><td> C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</td></tr>
<tr><td>%=</td><td>Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to  left operand</td><td> C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&lt;=</td><td>Left shift AND assignment operator </td><td> C &lt;&lt;= 2 is same as  C = C &lt;&lt; 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;&gt;=</td><td>Right shift AND assignment operator </td><td> C &gt;&gt;= 2 is same as  C = C &gt;&gt; 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;=</td><td>Bitwise AND assignment operator</td><td> C &amp;= 2 is same as  C = C &amp; 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>^=</td><td>bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator</td><td> C ^= 2 is same as  C = C ^ 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>|=</td><td>bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator</td><td> C |= 2 is same as  C = C | 2</td></tr>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Try the following example to understand all the assignment operators available in C programming language:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
   int a = 21;
   int c ;

   c =  a;
   printf("Line 1 - =  Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c +=  a;
   printf("Line 2 - += Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c -=  a;
   printf("Line 3 - -= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c *=  a;
   printf("Line 4 - *= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c /=  a;
   printf("Line 5 - /= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c  = 200;
   c %=  a;
   printf("Line 6 - %= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c &lt;&lt;=  2;
   printf("Line 7 - &lt;&lt;= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c &gt;&gt;=  2;
   printf("Line 8 - &gt;&gt;= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c &amp;=  2;
   printf("Line 9 - &amp;= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c ^=  2;
   printf("Line 10 - ^= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

   c |=  2;
   printf("Line 11 - |= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When you compile and execute the above program it produces the following result:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
Line 1 - =  Operator Example, Value of c = 21
Line 2 - += Operator Example, Value of c = 42
Line 3 - -= Operator Example, Value of c = 21
Line 4 - *= Operator Example, Value of c = 441
Line 5 - /= Operator Example, Value of c = 21
Line 6 - %= Operator Example, Value of c = 11
Line 7 - &lt;&lt;= Operator Example, Value of c = 44
Line 8 - &gt;&gt;= Operator Example, Value of c = 11
Line 9 - &amp;= Operator Example, Value of c = 2
Line 10 - ^= Operator Example, Value of c = 0
Line 11 - |= Operator Example, Value of c = 2
</pre></td></tr></table>
