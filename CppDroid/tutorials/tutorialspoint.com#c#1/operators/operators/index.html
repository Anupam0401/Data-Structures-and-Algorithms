<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Arithmetic Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Relational Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Logical Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Bitwise Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Assignment Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Misc Operators</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial will explain the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment and other operators one by one.</p>

<p>Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &amp;, |, and ^ are as follows:</p>
<table class="src">

<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:</p>
<p>A = 0011 1100</p>
<p>B = 0000 1101</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>A&amp;B = 0000 1100</p>
<p>A|B = 0011 1101</p>
<p>A^B = 0011 0001</p>
<p>~A&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>
<p>The Bitwise operators supported by C language are listed in the following table. Assume variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13, then:</p>
<p><a href="/cprogramming/c_bitwise_operators.htm" title="Bitwise Operators in C">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:10%">Operator</th><th style="width:55%;">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td> Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. </td><td> (A &amp; B) will give 12, which is 0000 1100</td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td> Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand. </td><td> (A | B) will give 61, which is 0011 1101</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td> Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. </td><td> (A ^ B) will give 49, which is 0011 0001</td></tr>

<h2> Misc Operators &map; sizeof &amp; ternary</h2>
<p>There are few other important operators including <b>sizeof</b> and <b>? :</b>  supported by C Language.</p>
<p><a href="/cprogramming/c_sizeof_operator.htm" title="sizeof operator in C">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="src">

<h2>Operators Precedence in C</h2>
<p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.</p>
<p>For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
 <p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
