<p>Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable <b>A</b> holds 1 and variable <b>B</b> holds 0, then:</p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:10%">Operator</th><th style="width:55%;">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;&amp;</td><td> Called Logical AND  operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &amp;&amp; B) is false. </td></tr>
<tr><td>||</td><td>Called Logical OR Operator.  If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A || B) is true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>Called Logical NOT Operator.  Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.</td><td> !(A &amp;&amp; B) is true. </td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Try the following example to understand all the logical operators available in C programming language:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
   int a = 5;
   int b = 20;
   int c ;

   if ( a &amp;&amp; b )
   {
      printf("Line 1 - Condition is true\n" );
   }
   if ( a || b )
   {
      printf("Line 2 - Condition is true\n" );
   }
   /* lets change the value of  a and b */
   a = 0;
   b = 10;
   if ( a &amp;&amp; b )
   {
      printf("Line 3 - Condition is true\n" );
   }
   else
   {
      printf("Line 3 - Condition is not true\n" );
   }
   if ( !(a &amp;&amp; b) )
   {
      printf("Line 4 - Condition is true\n" );
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When you compile and execute the above program it produces the following result:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
Line 1 - Condition is true
Line 2 - Condition is true
Line 3 - Condition is not true
Line 4 - Condition is true
</pre></td></tr></table>
