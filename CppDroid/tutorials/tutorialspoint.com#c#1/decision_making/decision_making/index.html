<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>
<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages:</p>
<img src="{path}/decision_making.jpg" alt="Decision making statements in C" />
<p>C programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and <b>non-null</b> values as <b>true</b>, and if it is either <b>zero</b> or <b>null</b>, then it is assumed as <b>false</b> value.</p>
<p>C programming language provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="src">
<tr><th style="width:35%">Statement</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/cprogramming/if_statement_in_c.htm" title="if statement in C">if statement</a></td><td>An <b>if statement</b> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/cprogramming/if_else_statement_in_c.htm" title="if...else statement in C">if...else statement</a></td><td>An <b>if statement</b> can be followed by an optional <b>else statement</b>, which executes when the boolean expression is false.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/cprogramming/nested_if_statements_in_c.htm" title="nested if statements in C">nested if statements</a></td><td>You can use one <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement inside another <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement(s).</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm" title="switch statement in C">switch statement</a></td><td>A <b>switch</b> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/cprogramming/nested_switch_statements_in_c.htm" title="nested switch statements in C">nested switch statements</a></td><td>You can use one <b>switch</b> statement inside another <b>switch</b> statement(s).</td></tr>

<h2>The ? : Operator:</h2>
<p>We have covered <b>conditional operator ? :</b> in previous chapter which can be used to replace <b>if...else</b> statements. It has the following general form:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>
<p>The value of a ? expression is determined like this: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.</p>
