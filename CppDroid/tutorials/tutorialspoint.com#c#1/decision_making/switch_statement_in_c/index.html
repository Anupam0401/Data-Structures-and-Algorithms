<p>A <b>switch</b> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each <b>switch case</b>.</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p>The syntax for a <b>switch</b> statement in C programming language is as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
switch(expression){
    case constant-expression  :
       statement(s);
       break; /* optional */
    case constant-expression  :
       statement(s);
       break; /* optional */
  
    /* you can have any number of case statements */
    default : /* Optional */
       statement(s);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The following rules apply to a <b>switch</b> statement:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>expression</b> used in a <b>switch</b> statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.</p></li>
<li><p>You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>constant-expression</b> for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal.</p></li>
<li><p>When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a <b>break</b> statement is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>When a <b>break</b> statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Not every case needs to contain a <b>break</b>. If no <b>break</b> appears, the flow of control will <i>fall through</i> to subsequent cases until a break is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>switch</b> statement can have an optional <b>default</b> case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No <b>break</b> is needed in the default case.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Example:</h2>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main ()
{
   /* local variable definition */
   char grade = 'B';

   switch(grade)
   {
   case 'A' :
      printf("Excellent!\n" );
      break;
   case 'B' :
   case 'C' :
      printf("Well done\n" );
      break;
   case 'D' :
      printf("You passed\n" );
      break;
   case 'F' :
      printf("Better try again\n" );
      break;
   default :
      printf("Invalid grade\n" );
   }
   printf("Your grade is  %c\n", grade );
 
   return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
Well done
Your grade is B
</pre></td></tr></table>
