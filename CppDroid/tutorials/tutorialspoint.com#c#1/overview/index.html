<p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.</p>
<p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&amp;R standard.</p>
<p>The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C. The C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Easy to learn</p></li>
<li><p>Structured language</p></li>
<li><p>It produces efficient programs.</p></li>
<li><p>It can handle low-level activities.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Facts about C</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p></li>
<li><p>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around 1970</p></li>
<li><p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p></li>
<li><p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C by 1973.</p></li>
<li><p>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the state-of-the-art softwares have been implemented using C.</p></li>
<li><p>Today's most popular Linux OS and RBDMS MySQL have been written in C.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why to use C?</h2>
<p>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted  as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Operating Systems</p></li>
<li><p>Language Compilers</p></li>
<li><p>Assemblers</p></li>
<li><p>Text Editors</p></li>
<li><p>Print Spoolers</p></li>
<li><p>Network Drivers</p></li>
<li><p>Modern Programs</p></li>
<li><p>Databases</p></li>
<li><p>Language Interpreters</p></li>
<li><p>Utilities</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>C Programs</h2>
<p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension <b>".c"</b>; for example, <i>hello.c</i>. You can use <b>"vi"</b>, <b>"vim"</b> or any other text editor to write your C program into a file. </p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.</p>
