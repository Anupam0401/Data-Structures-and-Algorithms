<p>A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value as shown below.</p>

<p>A variable that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared as such. This is done by placing an additional asterisk in front of its name. For example, following is the declaration to declare a  pointer to a pointer of type int:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
int **var;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice, as is shown below in the example:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint tryit">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main ()
{
   int  var;
   int  *ptr;
   int  **pptr;

   var = 3000;

   /* take the address of var */
   ptr = &amp;var;

   /* take the address of ptr using address of operator &amp; */
   pptr = &amp;ptr;

   /* take the value using pptr */
   printf("Value of var = %d\n", var );
   printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", *ptr );
   printf("Value available at **pptr = %d\n", **pptr);

   return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
Value of var = 3000
Value available at *ptr = 3000
Value available at **pptr = 3000
</pre></td></tr></table>
