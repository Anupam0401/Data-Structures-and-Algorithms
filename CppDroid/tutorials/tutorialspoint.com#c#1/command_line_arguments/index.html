<p>It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called <b>command line arguments</b> and many times they are important for your program specially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.</p>
<p>The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where <b>argc</b> refers to the number of arguments passed, and <b>argv[]</b> is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( int argc, char *argv[] )  
{
   if( argc == 2 )
   {
      printf("The argument supplied is %s\n", argv[1]);
   }
   else if( argc &gt; 2 )
   {
      printf("Too many arguments supplied.\n");
   }
   else
   {
      printf("One argument expected.\n");
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument, it produces the following result.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
$./a.out testing
The argument supplied is testing
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
$./a.out testing1 testing2
Too many arguments supplied.
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
$./a.out
One argument expected
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>It should be noted that <b>argv[0]</b> holds the name of the program itself and <b>argv[1]</b> is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, otherwise and if you pass one argument then <b>argc</b> is set at 2.</p>
<p>You pass all the command line arguments  separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( int argc, char *argv[] )  
{
   printf("Program name %s\n", argv[0]);
 
   if( argc == 2 )
   {
      printf("The argument supplied is %s\n", argv[1]);
   }
   else if( argc &gt; 2 )
   {
      printf("Too many arguments supplied.\n");
   }
   else
   {
      printf("One argument expected.\n");
   }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="result">
$./a.out "testing1 testing2"

Progranm name ./a.out
The argument supplied is testing1 testing2
</pre></td></tr></table>
