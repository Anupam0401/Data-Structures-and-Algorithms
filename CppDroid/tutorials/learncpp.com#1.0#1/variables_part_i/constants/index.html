<p><strong>Literal constants</strong></p>
<p>Literal constants are literal numbers inserted into the code.  They are constants because you can&#8217;t change their values.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int x = 5; // 5 is a literal constant
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Literal constants can have suffixes that determine their types.  Integer constants can have a u or U suffix that means they are unsigned.  Integer constants can also have a l or L suffix, which means they are long integers.  However, these suffixes are typically optional, as the compiler can usually tell from context what kind of constant you need.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
unsigned int nValue = 5u; // unsigned constant
long nValue2 = 5L; // long constant
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>By default, floating point literal constant have a type of <em>double</em>.  To convert them into a float value, the f or F suffix can be used:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
float fValue = 5.0f; // float constant
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Floating point literal constants can also use an l or L suffix to make them long doubles.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a good idea to try to avoid using literal constants that aren&#8217;t 0 or 1.  For more detail, you can review the section on <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/?p=33">magic numbers</a>, and why they are a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>Symbolic constants</strong></p>
<p>As you learned in a previous lesson, you can use the #define preprocessor directive in order to declare a symbolic constant:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#define YEN_PER_DOLLAR  122
int nYen = nDollars * YEN_PER_DOLLAR;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>There are two major problems with symbolic constants declared using #define.  First, because they are resolved by the preprocessor, which replaces the symbolic name with the defined value, #defined symbolic constants do not show up in the debugger.  Thus, if you only saw the statement <code>int nYen = nDollars * YEN_PER_DOLLAR;</code>, you would have to go looking for the #define declaration in order to find out what value of YEN_PER_DOLLAR was used.</p>
<p>Second, #defined values always have global scope (which we&#8217;ll talk about in the section on local and global variables).  This means a value #defined in one piece of code may have a naming conflict with a value #defined with the same name in another piece of code.</p>
<p>A better way to do symbolic constants is through use of the <strong>const</strong> keyword.  Const variables must be assigned a value when declared, and then that value can not be changed.  Here is the way the above snippet of code should be written:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const int nYenPerDollar = 122;
int nYen = nDollars * nYenPerDollar;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Declaring a variable as const prevents us from inadvertently changing it&#8217;s value:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const int nYenPerDollar = 122;
nYenPerDollar = 123; // compiler error!
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Although a constant variable might seem like an oxymoron, they can be very useful in helping to document your code and avoid magic numbers.  Some programmers prefer to use all upper-case names for const variables (to match the style of #defined values).  However, we will use normal variable naming conventions, which is more common.  Const variables act exactly like normal variables in every case except that they can not be assigned to.</p>
