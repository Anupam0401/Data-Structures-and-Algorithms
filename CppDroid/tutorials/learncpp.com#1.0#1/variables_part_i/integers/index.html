</div><p>An <strong>integer</strong> type variable is a variable that can only hold whole numbers (eg. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).  C++ actually has <em>four</em> different integer variables available for use: <strong>char</strong>, <strong>short</strong>, <strong>int</strong>, and <strong>long</strong>.  The only difference between these different integer types is that they have varying sizes &#8212; the larger integers can hold bigger numbers.  You can use the <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/?p=43">sizeof operator</a> to determine how large each type is on your machine.</p>
<p>In the following tutorials, we will typically assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>a char is 1 byte
<li>a short is 2 bytes
<li>an int is either 2 or 4 bytes
<li>a long is 4 bytes
</ul>
<p>Declaring some integers:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
char chChar;
short int nShort; // &quot;short int&quot; is technically correct
short nShort2; // &quot;short&quot; is preferred shorthand
int nInteger;
long int nLong; // &quot;long int&quot; is technically correct
long nLong2; // &quot;long&quot; is preferred shorthand
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>While <em>short int</em> and <em>long int</em> are technically correct, we prefer to use the shorthand versions <em>short</em> and <em>long</em> instead.  Adding the prefix <em>int</em> makes the type harder to distinguish from variables of type int.  This can lead to mistakes (such as overflow) if the short or long modifier is inadvertently missed.</p>
<p>Because the size of char, short, int, and long can vary depending on the compiler and/or computer architecture, it can be instructive to refer to integers by their size rather than name.   We often refer to integers by the number of bits or bytes  a variable of that type is allocated.</p>
<p>As you learned in the last section, a variable with n bits can store 2^n different values.  We call the set of values that a data type can hold it&#8217;s <strong>range</strong>.  Integers can have two different ranges, depending on whether they are signed or unsigned.</p>
<p><strong>Signed and unsigned variables</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>signed</strong> integer is a variable that can hold both negative and positive numbers.  To declare a variable as signed, you can use the <em>signed</em> keyword:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
signed char chChar;
signed short nShort;
signed int nInt;
signed long nLong;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A 1-byte signed variable has a range of -128 to 127.  Any value between -128 and 127 (inclusive) can be put in a 1-byte signed variable safely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we know in advance that we are not going to need negative numbers.  This is common when using a variable to store the quantity or size of something (such as your height &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to have a negative height!).  An <strong>unsigned</strong> integer is one that can only hold positive values.  To declare a variable as unsigned, use the <em>unsigned</em> keyword:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
unsigned char chChar;
unsigned short nShort;
unsigned int nInt;
unsigned long nLong;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A 1-byte unsigned variable has a range of 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Note that declaring a variable as unsigned means that it can not store negative numbers, but it can store positive numbers that are twice as large!</p>
<p>So what happens if we do not declare a variable as signed or unsigned?  All integer variables except char are signed by default.  Char can be either signed or unsigned by default (but is usually signed).</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
short nShort; // signed by default
int nInt; // signed by default
long nLong; // signed by default
char chChar; // can be signed or unsigned by default, but probably signed.
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>New programmers sometimes get signed and unsigned mixed up.  The following is a simple way to remember the difference: in order to differentiate positive and negative numbers, we typically use a negative sign.  If a sign is not provided, we assume a number is positive.  Consequently, an integer with a sign (a signed integer) can tell the difference between positive and negative.  An integer without a sign (an unsigned integer) assumes all values are positive.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the difference between signed and unsigned, let&#8217;s take a look at the ranges for different sized signed and unsigned variables:</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<th>Size/Type</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 byte signed</td>
<td>-128 to 127</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 byte unsigned</td>
<td>0 to 255</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 byte signed</td>
<td>-32,768 to 32,767</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 byte unsigned</td>
<td>0 to 65,535</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 byte signed</td>
<td>-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</td>
</tr>

<td>4 byte unsigned</td>
<td>0 to 4,294,967,296</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8 byte signed</td>
<td>-9,223,372,036,854,775,807 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>For the math inclined, an n-bit signed variable has a range of -(2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1))-1.  An n-bit unsigned variable has a range of 0 to (2^n)-1.  For the non-math inclined&#8230; use the table. :)</p>
<p>What happens if we try to put a number outside of the data type&#8217;s range into our variable?  We get&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Overflow</strong></p>
<p>In binary, we count from 0 to 15 like this: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111.  As you can see, the larger numbers require more bits to represent.  Because our variables have a fixed number of bits, this puts a limit on the largest number they can hold.</p>
<p>Consider a hypothetical variable that can only hold 4 bits.  Any of the binary numbers enumerated above would fit comfortably inside this variable because none of them are larger than 4 bits.  But what happens if we try to assign a value that takes 5 bits to our variable?  We get overflow: our variable will only store 4 of the 5 bits, and the excess bits are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Overflow</strong> occurs when bits are lost because a variable does not have enough memory to store them.</p>
<p>We can see this in action with the following program:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    unsigned short x = 65535; // largest 2-byte unsigned value possible
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x was: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
    x = x + 1; // We desire 65536, but we get overflow!
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x is now: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>What do you think the result of this program will be?</p>
<pre>
x was: 65535
x is now: 0
</pre>
<p>What happened?  Informally, we overflowed the variable by trying to put a number that was too big into it, and the result is that our value &#8220;wrapped around&#8221; back to the beginning of the range.  For non-integer data types, overflowed variables do not always wrap around the range, so do not rely on this happening!</p>
<p>The following paragraph explains exactly why we ended up getting a value of 0 after overflow.  It is optional reading.  If all this binary stuff is confusing, you can skip it.</p>
<p>The number 65,535 is represented by the bit pattern <code>1111 1111 1111 1111</code> in binary.  65,535 is the largest number an unsigned 2 byte (16-bit) integer can hold, as it uses all 16 bits.  When we add 1 to the value, the new value should be 65,536.  However, the bit pattern of 65,536 is represented in binary as <code>1 0000 0000 0000 0000</code>, which is 17 bits!  Consequently, the highest bit (which is the 1) is lost, and the low 16 bits are all that is left.  The bit pattern <code>0000 0000 0000 0000</code> corresponds to the number 0, which is our result!</p>
<p>Similarly, we can overflow the bottom end of our range as well.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    unsigned short x = 0; // smallest 2-byte unsigned value possible
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x was: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
    x = x - 1; // We expect -1, we get overflow!
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x is now: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<pre>
x was: 0
x is now: 65535
</pre>
<p>In the case of a signed integer, the result is identical.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    signed short x = 32767; // largest 2-byte signed value possible
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x was: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
    x = x + 1; // We desire 32768, but we get overflow!
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x is now: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<pre>
x was: 32767
x is now: -32768
</pre>
<p>Overflow results in information being lost, which is almost never desirable.  If there is ANY doubt that a variable might need to store a value that falls outside it&#8217;s range, use a larger variable!</p>
<p><strong>Integer division</strong></p>
<p>Integer division can also cause issues because dividing 2 integers can produce a fractional result, and integers can not store fractions.  Consider the statement <code>int x = 5 / 3;</code>.  Under normal mathematical rules, x would be assigned the value of 5/3, which is 1.6666.  However, in integer division, the fraction is dropped, so x is assigned the value of 1.  Integer division always drops the fraction &#8212; it does not round.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed width integers</strong></p>
<p>Some compilers provide access to fixed width integers (integers whose size is not dependent on the platform).  Since these are not officially part of the C++ standard, information on these has been relegated to appendix <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a-6-fixed-width-integers/">A.6 &#8212; Fixed width integers</a>.  Nevertheless, I recommend you check them out.</p>
