<p>Consider the following struct:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
struct DateStruct
{
    int nMonth;
    int nDay;
    int nYear;
};

int main()
{
    DateStruct sDate;
    sDate.nMonth = 10;
    sDate.nDay = 14;
    sDate.nYear = 2020;

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In this program, we declare a DateStruct and then we directly access it&#8217;s members in order to initialize them.  This works because all members of a struct are public members.  <strong>Public members</strong> are members of a struct or class that can be accessed by any function in the program.</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider the following almost-identical class:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
class Date
{
    int m_nMonth;
    int m_nDay;
    int m_nYear;
};

int main()
{
    Date cDate;
    cDate.m_nMonth = 10;
    cDate.m_nDay = 14;
    cDate.m_nYear = 2020;

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>If you were to compile this program, you would receive an error.  This is because by default, all members of a class are private.  <strong>Private members</strong> are members of a class that can only be accessed by other functions within the class.  Because main() is not a member of the Date class, it does not have access to Date&#8217;s private members.</p>
<p>Although class members are private by default, we can make them public by using the public keyword:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
class Date
{
public:
    int m_nMonth; // public
    int m_nDay; // public
    int m_nYear; // public
};

int main()
{
    Date cDate;
    cDate.m_nMonth = 10; // okay because m_nMonth is public
    cDate.m_nDay = 14;  // okay because m_nDay is public
    cDate.m_nYear = 2020;  // okay because m_nYear is public

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Because Date&#8217;s members are now public, they can be accessed by main().</p>
<p>One of the primary differences between classes and structs is that classes can explicitly use <strong>access specifiers</strong> to restrict who can access members of a class.  C++ provides 3 different access specifier keywords: public, private, and protected.  We will discuss the protected access specifier when we cover inheritance.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a class that uses all three access specifiers:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
class Access
{
   int m_nA; // private by default
   int GetA() { return m_nA; } // private by default

private:
   int m_nB; // private
   int GetB() { return m_nB; } // private

protected:
   int m_nC; // protected
   int GetC() { return m_nC; } // protected

public:
   int m_nD; // public
   int GetD() { return m_nD; } // public

};

int main()
{
    Access cAccess;
    cAccess.m_nD = 5; // okay because m_nD is public
    std::cout &lt;&lt; cAccess.GetD(); // okay because GetD() is public

    cAccess.m_nA = 2; // WRONG because m_nA is private
    std::cout &lt;&lt; cAccess.GetB(); // WRONG because GetB() is private

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Each of the members &#8220;acquires&#8221; the access level of the previous access specifier.  It is common convention to list private members first.</p>
<p>Why would you want to restrict access to class members?  Oftentimes you want to declare members that are for &#8220;internal class use only&#8221;.  For example, when writing a string class, it is common to declare a private member named m_nLength that holds the length of the string.  If m_nLength were public, anybody could change the length of the string without changing the actual string!  This could cause all sorts of bizarre problems.  Consequently, the m_nLength is made private so that only functions within the String class can alter m_nLength.</p>
<p>The group of public members of a class are often referred to as a &#8220;public interface&#8221;.  Because only public members can be accessed outside of the class, the public interface defines how programs using the class will interface with the class.</p>
