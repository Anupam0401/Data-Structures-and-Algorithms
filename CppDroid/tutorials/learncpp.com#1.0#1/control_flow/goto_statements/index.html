</div><p>The <strong>goto statement</strong> is a control flow statement that causes the CPU to jump to another spot in the code.  This spot is identified through use of a <strong>statement label</strong>.  The following is an example of a goto statement and statement label:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

int main()
{
    using namespace std;
tryAgain: // this is a statement label
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter a non-negative number&quot;;
    double dX;
    cin &gt;&gt; dX;

    if (dX &lt; 0.0)
        goto tryAgain; // this is the goto statement

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The sqrt of &quot; &lt;&lt; dX &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot; &lt;&lt; sqrt(dX) &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In this program, the user is asked to enter a non-negative number.  However, if a negative number is entered, the program utilizes a goto statement to jump back to the tryAgain label.  The user is then asked again to enter a new number.  In this way, we can continually ask the user for input until he or she enters something valid.</p>
<p>In the section on variables, we covered three kinds of scope: local (block) scope, file scope, and global scope.  Statement labels utilize a fourth kind of scope: function scope.  The goto statement and it&#8217;s corresponding statement label must appear in the same function.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on goto use.  For example, you can&#8217;t jump forward over a variable that&#8217;s initialized in the same block as the goto:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main()
{
    goto skip; // invalid forward jump
    int x = 5;
skip:
    x += 3; // what would this even evaluate to?
    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In general, use of goto is shunned in C++ (and most other high level languages as well).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a>, a noted computer scientist, laid out the case in a famous but difficult to read paper called <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>.  Almost any program written using a goto statement can be more clearly written using loops.  The primary problem with goto is that it allows a programmer to cause the point of execution to jump around the code arbitrarily.  This creates what is not-so-affectionately known as <strong>spaghetti code</strong>.  Spaghetti code has a path of execution that resembles a bowl of spaghetti (all tangled and twisted), making it extremely difficult to follow the logic of such code.</p>
<p>As Dijkstra says somewhat humorously, &#8220;the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in the programs they produce&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>Rule: Avoid use of goto unless necessary</em></p>
