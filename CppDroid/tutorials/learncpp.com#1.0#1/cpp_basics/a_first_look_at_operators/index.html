<p>In the section <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/?p=19">Introduction to programming</a>, we had defined an expression as &#8220;A mathematical entity that evaluates to a value&#8221;.  However, the term <em>mathematical entity</em> is somewhat vague.  More precisely, an <strong>expression</strong> is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a value.</p>
<p>A <strong>literal</strong> is simply a number, such as 5, or 3.14159.  When we talk about the expression &#8220;3 + 4&#8243;, both 3 and 4 are literals.  Literals always evaluate to themselves.</p>
<p>You have already seen variables and functions.  Variables evaluate to the values they hold.  Functions evaluate to produce a value of the function&#8217;s return type.  Because functions that return void do not have return values, they are usually not part of expressions.</p>
<p>Literals, variables, and functions are all known as operands.  <strong>Operands</strong> are the objects of an expression that are acted upon.  Operands supply the data that the expression works with.</p>
<p><strong>Operators</strong></p>
<p>The last piece of the expressions puzzle is operators.  <strong>Operators</strong> tell how to combine the operands to produce a new result.  For example, in the expression &#8220;3 + 4&#8243;, the + is the plus operator.  The + operator tells how to combine the operands 3 and 4 to produce a new value (7).</p>
<p>You are likely already quite familiar with standard arithmetic operators, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).  Assignment (=) is an operator as well.</p>
<p>Operators come in two types:<br />
<strong>Unary</strong> operators act on one operand.  An example of a unary operator is the &#8211; operator.  In the expression <code>-5</code>, the &#8211; operator is only being applied to one operand (5) to produce a new value (-5).</p>
<p><strong>Binary</strong> operators act on two operands (known as left and right).  An example of a binary operator is the + operator.  In the expression <code>3 + 4</code>, the + operator is working with a left operand (3) and a right operand (4) to produce a new value (7).</p>
<p>Note that some operators have more than one meaning.  For example, the &#8211; operator has two contexts.  It can be used in unary form to invert a number&#8217;s sign (eg. -5), or it can be used in binary form to do arithmetic subtraction (eg. 4 &#8211; 3).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of operators.  We will take an in-depth look at operators in more detail in a future section.</p>
