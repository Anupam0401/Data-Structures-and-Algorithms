</div><p><strong>Unary arithmetic operators</strong></p>
<p>There are two unary arithmetic operators, plus (+), and minus (-).  If you remember, unary operators are operators that only take one operand.</p>

</table>
<p>The unary plus operator returns the value of the operand.  In other words, +5 = 5, and +x = x.</p>
<p>The unary minus operator returns the operand multiplied by -1.  In other words, if x = 5, -x = -5.</p>
<p>For best effect, both of these operators should be placed immediately preceding the operand (eg. <code>-x</code>, not <code>- x</code>).</p>
<p>Do not confuse the unary minus operator with the binary subtraction operator, which uses the same symbol.  For example, in the expression <code>x = 5 - -3;</code>, the first minus is the subtraction operator, and the second is the unary minus operator.</p>
<p><strong>Binary arithmetic operators</strong></p>
<p>There are 5 binary arithmetic operators.  Binary operators are operators that take a left and right operand.</p>

<p>Of these operators, the only ones that really need further explanation are division and modulus (remainder).</p>
<p><strong>Integer and floating point division</strong></p>
<p>It is easiest to think of the division operator as having two different &#8220;modes&#8221;.  If both of the operands are integers, the division operator performs integer division.  Integer division drops any fractions and returns an integer value.  For example, 7 / 3 = 2 because the fraction is dropped.  Note that integer division does not round.  For example, 3 / 4 = 0, not 1.</p>
<p>If either or both of the operands are floating point values, the division operator performs floating point division.  Floating point division returns a floating point value, and the fraction is kept.  For example, 7.0 / 3 = 2.333,  7 / 3.0 = 2.333, and 7.0 / 3.0 = 2.333.</p>
<p>Note that trying to divide by 0 (or 0.0) will generally cause your program to crash, as the result are undefined!</p>
<p><strong>Modulus (remainer)</strong></p>
<p>The modulus operator is also informally known as the remainder operator.  The modulus operator only works on integer operands, and it returns the remainder after doing integer division.  For example, 7 / 3 = 2 remainder 1, thus  7 % 3 = 1.  As another example, 25 / 7 = 3 remainder 4, thus 25 % 7 = 4.</p>
<p>Modulus is very useful for testing whether a number is evenly divisible by another number: if x % y == 0, then we know that y divides evenly into x.  This can be useful when trying to do something every nth iteration.</p>
<p>For example, say we wanted to write a program that printed every number from 1 to 100 with 20 numbers per line.  We could use the modulus operator to determine where to do the line breaks.  Even though you haven&#8217;t seen a while statement yet, the following program should be pretty comprehensible:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    using namespace std;

    // nCount holds the current number to print
    int nCount = 1; // start at 1

    // Loop continually until we pass number 100
    while (nCount &lt;= 100)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; nCount &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; // print the current number

        // if nCount is divisible by 20, print a new line
        if (nCount % 20 == 0)
            cout &lt;&lt; endl;

        nCount = nCount + 1; // go to next number
    } // end of while
} // end of main()
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p><strong>A warning about integer division and modulus with negative numbers</strong></p>
<p>If either or both operands of integer division are negative, the compiler is free to truncate up or down!  Most modern compilers round towards 0.  For example, -5 / 2 can evaluate to either -3 or -2, depending on whether the compiler rounds down or rounds toward 0.</p>
<p>If either operand of the modulus operator is negative, the results of the modulus can be either negative or positive!  For example, -5 % 2 can evaluate to either 1 or -1.</p>

<p>By now, you should already be well acquainted with the assignment operator, so no need to discuss it here.  Because writing statements such as x = x + y is so common, C++ provides 5 arithmetic assignment operators for convenience.  For example, instead of writing x = x + y, you can write x += y.  Instead of x = x * 5, you can write x *= 5.</p>

<div class="solution_div" id="id758676155" style="display:none"> Because * and % have higher precedence than +, the + will evaluate last.  We can rewrite our expression as 6 + (5 * 4 % 3).  * and % have the same precedence, so we have to look at the associativity to resolve them.  The associativity for * and % is left to right, so we resolve the left operator first.  We can rewrite our expression like this: 6 + ((5 * 4) % 3).</p>
<p>6 + ((5 * 4) % 3) = 6 + (20 % 3) = 6 + 2 = 8</p></div>

<div class="solution_div" id="id2087133725" style="display:none"> When using integer division, a right operand of 0 will have undefined results and probably crash your program.  Also, if either of the operands are negative, the direction of truncation is undefined.</div>
