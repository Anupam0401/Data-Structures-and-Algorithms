</div><p>As you learned in the <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/04-introduction-to-development/">introduction to development</a> lesson, when you compile and link your program, the compiler produces an executable file.  When a program is run, execution starts at the top of the function called main().  Up to this point, we&#8217;ve declared main like this:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main()
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Notice that this version of main() takes no parameters.  However, many programs need some kind of input to work with.  For example, let&#8217;s say you were writing a program called WordCount to count the number of words in a text file.  What text file should be read and processed?  The user has to have some way of telling the program which file to open.  To do this, you might take this approach:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please enter a filename: &quot;;
    char strFilename[255];
    cin &gt;&gt; strFilename;

    // open file and process it
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>However, there is a major problem with this approach.  Every time the program is run, the program will wait for the user to enter input.  That means execution of the program can not be automated very easily.  For example, if you wanted to run this program on 500 files every week, the program would stop and wait for you to enter a new filename each and every time it was run.  And you&#8217;d have to do so by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Command line arguments</strong></p>
<p>For programs that have minimal and/or optional inputs, command line arguments offer a great way to make programs more modular.  <strong>Command line arguments</strong> are optional string arguments that a user can give to a program upon execution.  These arguments are passed by the operating system to the program, and the program can use them as input.</p>
<p>Programs are normally run by invoking them by name.  On the command line, to run a program, you can simply type in its name.  For example, to run the executable file &#8220;WordCount&#8221; that is located in the root directory of the C:\ drive on a Windows machine, you could type:</p>
<pre>
C:\\&gt;WordCount
</pre>
<p>In order to pass command line arguments to WordCount, we simply list the command line arguments after the executable name:</p>
<pre>
C:\\&gt;WordCount Myfile.txt
</pre>
<p>Now when WordCount is executed, Myfile.txt will be provided as a command line argument.  A program can have multiple command line arguments, separated by spaces:</p>
<pre>
C:\\&gt;WordCount Myfile.txt Myotherfile.txt
</pre>
<p>This also works for other command line operating systems, such as Linux (though your prompt and directory structure will undoubtedly vary).</p>
<p>If you are running your program from an IDE, the IDE should provide a way to enter command line arguments.  For example, in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, right click on your project in the solution explorer, then choose properties.  Open the &#8220;Configuration Properties&#8221; tree element, and choose &#8220;Debugging&#8221;.  In the right pane, there is a line called &#8220;Command Arguments&#8221;.  You can enter your command line arguments there for testing, and they will be automatically passed to your program when you run it.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to provide command line arguments to a program, the next step is to access them from within our C++ program.  To do that, we use a different form of main() than we&#8217;ve seen before.  This new form of main() takes two arguments (named argc and argv by convention) as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>You will sometimes also see it written as:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main(int argc, char** argv)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Even though these are essentially the same, we prefer the first representation because it&#8217;s intuitively easier to understand.</p>
<p><strong>argc</strong> is an integer parameter containing a count of the number of arguments passed to the program (think: argc = <b>arg</b>ument <b>c</b>ount).  argc will always be at least 1, because the first argument is always the name of the program itself!  Each command line argument the user provides will cause argc to increase by 1.</p>
<p><strong>argv</strong> is where the actual arguments themselves are stored.  Although the declaration of argv looks intimidating, argv is really just an array of C-style strings.  The length of this array is argc.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s write a short program to print the value of all the command line parameters:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    using namespace std;

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;There are &quot; &lt;&lt; argc &lt;&lt; &quot; arguments:&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Loop through each argument and print its number and value
    for (int nArg=0; nArg &lt; argc; nArg++)
        cout &lt;&lt; nArg &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[nArg] &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Now, when we invoke this program with the command line arguments &#8220;Myfile.txt&#8221; and &#8220;100&#8243;, the output will be as follows:</p>
<pre>
There are 3 arguments:
0 C:\\WordCount
1 Myfile.txt
2 100
</pre>
<p>Argument 0 is always the name of the current program being run.  Argument 1 and 2 in this case are the two command line parameters we passed in.</p>
<p>Back to our previous example, let&#8217;s go ahead and partially write WordCount so it uses command line arguments instead of asking the user for input:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    using namespace std;
    // If the user didn't provide a filename command line argument,
    // print an error and exit.
    if (argc &lt;= 1)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Usage: &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; &quot; &lt;Filename&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    char *pFilename = argv[1];

    // open file and process it
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Now, when WordCount is run, it will not require any user interaction.  This means we can have a batch file, script, or even another program run WordCount many times in a row (with different command line arguments) in an automated manner.</p>
<p>Those of you studying computer science in school (or planning on taking programming classes) may find that your professors ask you to use command line arguments to provide inputs to the program rather than using cin.  Running each student&#8217;s program (when there are 50 or 100 students) and having to type in the same filenames or inputs to test whether the program works makes for slow grading and is tedious to boot.  By using command line arguments, professors and TAs can automate the process of running the student&#8217;s programs on a preselected set of inputs, using another program to compare whether the output matches known correct output.  This can speed up the overall grading process immensely.</p>
