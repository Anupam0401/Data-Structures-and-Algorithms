<p>By default, arguments in C++ are passed by value.  When arguments are <strong>passed by value</strong>, a copy of the argument is passed to the function.</p>
<p>Consider the following snippet:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
void foo(int y)
{
    using namespace std;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;y = &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main()
{
    foo(5); // first call

    int x = 6;
    foo(x); // second call
    foo(x+1); // third call

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In the first call to foo(), the argument is the literal 5.  When foo() is called, variable y is created, and the value of 5 is copied into y.  Variable y is then destroyed when foo() ends.</p>
<p>In the second call to foo(), the argument is the variable x.  x is evaluated to produce the value 6.  When foo() is called for the second time, variable y is created again, and the value of 6 is copied into y.  Variable y is then destroyed when foo() ends.</p>
<p>In the third call to foo(), the argument is the expression x+1.  x+1 is evaluated to produce the value 7, which is passed to variable y.  Variable y is once again destroyed when foo() ends.</p>
<p>Thus, this program prints:</p>
<pre>
y = 5
y = 6
y = 7
</pre>
<p>Because a copy of the argument is passed to the function, the original argument can not be modified by the function.  This is shown in the following example:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
void foo(int y)
{
    using namespace std;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;y = &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;

    y = 6;

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;y = &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
} // y is destroyed here

int main()
{
    using namespace std;
    int x = 5;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x = &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;

    foo(x);

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;x = &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This snippet outputs:</p>
<pre>
x = 5
y = 5
y = 6
x = 5
</pre>
<p>At first, x is 5.  When foo() is called, the value of x (5) is passed to variable y inside foo().  y is assigned the value of 6, and then destroyed.  The value of x is unchanged, even though y was changed.</p>
<p>Advantages of passing by value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments passed by value can be variables (eg. x), literals (eg. 6), or expressions (eg. x+1).
<li>Arguments are never changed by the function being called, which prevents side effects.
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of passing by value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying large structs or classes can take a lot of time to copy, and this can cause a performance penalty, especially if the function is called many times.
</ul>
<p>In most cases, pass by value is the best way to pass arguments to functions &#8212; it is flexible and safe.</p>
