</div><p>To recap the process needed to use a library:</p>
<p>Once per library:<br />
1) Acquire the library.  Download it from the website or via a package manager.<br />
2) Install the library.  Unzip it to a directory or install it via a package manager.<br />
3) Tell the compiler where to look for the header file(s) for the library.<br />
4) Tell the linker where to look for the library file(s) for the library.</p>
<p>Once per project:<br />
5) Tell the linker which static or import library files to link.<br />
6) #include the libraryâ€™s header file(s) in your program.<br />
7) Make sure the program know where to find any dynamic libraries being used.</p>
<p><strong>Steps 1 and 2 &#8212; Acquire and install library</strong></p>
<p>Download and install the library to your hard disk.  See the tutorial on <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/">static and dynamic libraries</a> for more information about this step.</p>
<p><strong>Steps 3 and 4 &#8212; Tell the compiler where to find headers and library files</strong></p>
<p>We are going to do this on a global basis so the library will be available to all of our projects.  Consequently, the following steps only need to be done once per library.</p>
<p>A) Go to the &#8220;Settings menu&#8221; and pick &#8220;Compiler&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="{path}/CB-SettingsMenu.png"></p>
<p>B) Click the &#8220;Directories&#8221; tab.  The compiler tab will already be selected for you.</p>
<p>C) Press the &#8220;Add&#8221; button, and add the path to the .h files for the library.  If you are running Linux and installed the library via a package manager, make sure <em>/usr/include</em> is listed here.</p>

<p>D) Click the &#8220;Linker&#8221; tab.  Press the &#8220;Add&#8221; button, and add the path to the .lib files for the library.  If you are running Linux and installed the library via a package manager, make sure <em>/usr/lib</em> is listed here.</p>

<p>E) Press the &#8220;OK&#8221; button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 &#8212; Tell the linker which libraries your program is using</strong></p>
<p>For step 5, we need to add the library files from the library to our project.  We do this on an individual project basis.</p>
<p>A) Right click on the bolded project name under the default workspace (probably &#8220;Console application&#8221;, unless you changed it).  Choose &#8220;Build options&#8221; from the menu.</p>
<p><img src="{path}/CB-BuildOptions.png"></p>
<p>B) Click the linker tab.  Under the &#8220;Link libraries&#8221; window, press the &#8220;Add&#8221; button and add the library you wish your project to use.</p>
<p><img src="{path}/CB-Library.png"></p>
<p>C) Press the &#8220;OK&#8221; button</p>
<p><strong>Steps 6 and 7 &#8212; #include header files and make sure project can find DLLs</strong></p>
<p>Simply #include the header file(s) from the library in your project.</p>
