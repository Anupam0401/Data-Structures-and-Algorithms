<p>On August 12, 2011, the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html">ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</a> approved a new version of C++, called C++11.  C++11 adds a whole new set of features to the C++ language!  Use of these new features is entirely optional &#8212; but you will undoubtedly find some of them helpful.  We will only cover a portion of the new features here (those you are mostly likely to actually use).</p>
<p>Note that because C++11 is new (as of the time of writing), only modern compilers support it, and most of them only support it partially.  I&#8217;ll be using Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition for sample code.  Compatibility with other compilers may vary.  If you are using an older version of Visual Studio, now&#8217;s a good time to upgrade to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express">Visual Studio 2010 Express</a>, even though it&#8217;s support for C++11 is spotty at best at the time of writing.</p>
<p><strong>The goals and designs of C++11</strong></p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup characterized the goals of C++11 as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build on C++&#8217;s strengths &#8212; rather than trying to extend C++ to new areas where it may be weaker (eg. Windows applications with heavy GUI), focus on making it do what it does well even better.</li>
<li>Make C++ easier to learn, use, and teach &#8212; provide functionality that makes the language more consistent and easier to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>To that end, the committee that put the language together tried to obey the following general principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain stability and compatibility with older versions of C++ and C wherever possible.  Programs that worked under C++03 should generally still work under C++11.</li>
<li>Keep the number of core language extensions to a minimum, and put the bulk of the changes in the standard library (an objective that wasn&#8217;t met very well with this release)</li>
<li>Focus on improving abstraction mechanisms (classes, templates) rather than adding mechanisms to handle specific, narrow situations.</li>
<li>Add new functionality for both novices and experts.  A little of something for everybody!</li>
<li>Increase type safety, to prevent inadvertent bugs.</li>
<li>Improve performance and allow C++ to work directly with hardware.</li>
<li>Consider usability and ecosystem issues.  C++ needs to work well with other tools, be easy to use and teach, etc&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Since C++11 isn&#8217;t a large departure from C++03, it really doesn&#8217;t need any more introduction.  We&#8217;ll just dive right into the new features in the next lesson.</p>
