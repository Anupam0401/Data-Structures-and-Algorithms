</div><p><strong>Type long long</strong></p>
<p>In you recall from <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/24-integers/">lesson 2.4 &#8212; Integers</a>, the largest integer type C++03 defines is &#8220;long&#8221;.  Long has a platform-specific size that can be either 32 or 64 bits.  C++ defines a new type named <strong>long long</strong> that&#8217;s guaranteed to be at least 64 bits in length.  Because &#8220;long long&#8221; was already introduced by C99, many compilers already supported it prior to C++11.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, although C++11 imported long long from C99, they opted not to import <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a-6-fixed-width-integers/">fixed-width integers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Type inference with auto and decltype</strong></p>
<p>My favorite change in C++11 is the introduction of the <strong>auto</strong> keyword.  Consider the common use case where you want to iterate through a vector using a for loop:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (std::vector&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator itr = myvector.cbegin(); itr != myvector.cend(); ++itr)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Having to determine that the data type for the iterator itr is &#8220;std::vector<int>::const_iterator&#8221; is both a pain to get correct and obnoxious considering that the compiler already knows that the return type from cbegin() is std::vector<int>::const_iterator &#8212; but it makes you type it out anyway.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the auto keyword comes in:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (auto itr = myvector.cbegin(); itr != myvector.cend(); ++itr)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The auto keyword tells the compiler to infer the type of the variable from its initializer.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
auto x = 5; // x will be type int
auto y = 5.5; // y will be type double
auto z = y; // z will be type double
auto w = &quot;hi&quot;; // w will be type const char*
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The <strong>decltype</strong> can be used to determine the type of an expression at compile-type.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
decltype(5) x; // x will be type int because 5 is an int
decltype(x) y = 6; // y will be type int because x is an int
auto z = x; // z will type type int
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Although it may seem like auto and decltype will always deduce the same type, that isn&#8217;t the case, as shown by the following example:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const std::vector&lt;int&gt; v(5); // declare a vector v
auto a = v[0]; // a will be type int because v[0] is an int
decltype(v[0]) b = 1; // b will be type const int&amp;, which is the return type of std::vector&lt;int&gt;::operator[](size_type) const
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Generally, if you need a type for a variable you are going to initialize, use auto.  decltype is better used when you need the type for something that is not a variable, like a return type.</p>
<p><strong>Type nullptr</strong></p>
<p>In previous iterations of C and C++, 0 acted as both a constant integer and as the null pointer constant, which is why the following oddity occurs:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int *p = 1; // illegal, can't assign an int to an int* variable
int *q = 0; // legal, 0 has a special meaning as a null pointer
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>C++11 defines a new reserved identifier called <strong>nullptr</strong> (of type nullptr_t) that is not an integer, and can not be converted to an integer (though oddly enough, it can be converted to the boolean value false).  0 remains a valid null point constant for backwards compatibility purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Enum classes</strong></p>
<p>(Note: The following isn&#8217;t yet supported by Visual Studio 2010, but it&#8217;s simple enough to follow even without trying the examples yourself)</p>
<p>In C++03, enums are not type safe &#8212; they are treated as integers even when the enumeration types are distinct.  Consider the following case:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    enum Color
    {
        RED,
        BLUE
    };

    enum Fruit
    {
        BANANA,
        APPLE
    };

    Color a = RED;
    Fruit b = BANANA;

    if (a == b) // The compiler will compare a and b as integers
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;a and b are equal&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; // and find they are equal!
    else
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;a and b are not equal&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>When C++ compares a and b, it&#8217;s comparing them as integers, which means in the above example, a does equal b since they both default to integer 0.  This is definitely not as desired since a and b are from different enumerations!</p>
<p>C++11 defines a new concept, the <strong>enum class</strong>, which makes enums both strongly typed and strongly scoped.</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
int main()
{
    enum class Color
    {
        RED,
        BLUE
    };

    enum class Fruit
    {
        BANANA,
        APPLE
    };

    Color a = Color::RED; // note: RED is not accessible any more, we have to use Color::RED
    Fruit b = Fruit::BANANA; // note: BANANA is not accessible any more, we have to use Fruit::BANANA

    if (a == b) // compile error here, as the compiler doesn't know how to compare different types Color and Fruit
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;a and b are equal&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    else
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;a and b are not equal&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>With normal enums, you can access enumerators (eg. RED) directly in the surrounding scope (eg. within main).  However, with enum classes, the strong scoping rules mean you have to use a scope qualifier to access the enumerator (eg. Color::RED).  This helps keep name pollution and the potential for name conflicts down.</p>
<p>The strong typing rules means that C++ will look for an explicitly defined comparison function to compare Color and Fruit.  Since we haven&#8217;t defined an operator==(Color, Fruit) function, the compiler won&#8217;t understand how to compare a and b in any meaningful way, and this will cause a compile-time error to occur.</p>
