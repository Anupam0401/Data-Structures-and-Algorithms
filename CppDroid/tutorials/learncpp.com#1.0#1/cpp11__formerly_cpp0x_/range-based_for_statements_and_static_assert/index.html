<p>In C++03, stepping through all the values of a sequence requires a lot of code, particularly when using the iterator syntax:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator itr = myvector.begin(); itr != myvector.end(); ++itr)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>In C++11, the auto keyword makes this a little better:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (auto itr = myvector.begin(); itr != myvector.end(); ++itr)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>But this is such a common pattern that C++11 has introduced an even simpler syntax to allow us to iterate through sequences, called a <strong>range-based for statement</strong> (or sometimes called &#8220;for each&#8221;):</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (auto x: myvector) // x is read-only
{
    cout &lt;&lt; x;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>You can translate this as &#8220;for each value of x in myvector&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you want to modify the value of x, you can make x a reference</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
for (auto&amp; x: myvector) // x is modifiable
{
    cout &lt;&lt; ++x;
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This syntax works for C-style arrays and anything that supports an iterator via begin() and end() functions.  This includes all standard template library container classes (including std::string) and initialization_list (which we&#8217;ll cover in the next lesson).  You can also make it work for your custom classes by defining iterator-style begin() and end() member functions.  If you&#8217;re using an older class that doesn&#8217;t support begin() and end() member functions, you can write free standing begin(x) and end(x) functions and this syntax will still work.</p>
<p><strong>static_assert</strong></p>
<p>C++03 provides an assert macro that allows testing for assertions at runtime.  However, for templated programming, it&#8217;s sometimes useful to be able to test assertions at compile type.  C++11 provides a new keyword called <strong>static_assert</strong> that does a compile-time assertion test.</p>
<p>This allows you to do things like ensure the size of variables are what you expect:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
static_assert(sizeof(int) &gt;= 4, &quot;int needs to be 4 bytes to use this code&quot;);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Note that because static_assert is checked at compile time, it can not be used to evaluate assumptions that depend on runtime values.  Static_asserts is primarily useful for checking the size of things via sizeof() or determining that #defined values are within certain boundaries.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things you can do with static_assert is assert on whether your compiler supports C++11 by checking whether the value of __cplusplus is greater than 199711L:</p>
<table><tr><td class="source"><pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
static_assert(__cplusplus &gt; 199711L, &quot;Program requires C++11 capable compiler&quot;);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>You may wonder whether it&#8217;s redundant to check __cplusplus since compilers that don&#8217;t support static_assert will throw a compiler error when they reach the static_assert line.  The answer is that it is not redundant, as many compilers (including Visual Studio 2010) have partial support for C++11 and may understand static_assert without having a full C++11 implementation.  As of the time of writing, Visual Studio 2010 is in this case: it understands static_assert, but it leaves __cplusplus set to 199711L, because it&#8217;s implementation of C++11 is still pretty sparse.</p>
