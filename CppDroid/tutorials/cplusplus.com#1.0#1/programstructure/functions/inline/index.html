<h3>Inline functions</h3>
Calling a function generally causes a certain overhead (stacking arguments, jumps, etc...), and thus for very short functions, it may be more efficient to simply insert the code of the function where it is called, instead of performing the process of formally calling a function.<br>
<br>
Preceding a function declaration with the <code>inline</code> specifier informs the compiler that inline expansion is preferred over the usual function call mechanism for a specific function. This does not change at all the behavior of a function, but is merely used to suggest the compiler that the code generated by the function body shall be inserted at each point the function is called, instead of being invoked with a regular function call.<br>
<br>
For example, the concatenate function above may be declared inline as:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>inline</var> string concatenate (<var>const</var> string&amp; a, <var>const</var> string&amp; b)
{
  <var>return</var> a+b;
}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This informs the compiler that when <code>concatenate</code> is called, the program prefers the function to be expanded inline, instead of performing a regular call. <code>inline</code> is only specified in the function declaration, not when it is called.<br>
<br>
Note that most compilers already optimize code to generate inline functions when they see an opportunity to improve efficiency, even if not explicitly marked with the <code>inline</code> specifier. Therefore, this specifier merely indicates the compiler that inline is preferred for this function, although the compiler is free to not inline it, and optimize otherwise. In C++, optimization is a task delegated to the compiler, which is free to generate any code for as long as the resulting behavior is the one specified by the code.<br>
