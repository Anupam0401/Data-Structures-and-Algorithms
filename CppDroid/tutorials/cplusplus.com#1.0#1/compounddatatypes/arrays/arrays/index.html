An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.<br>
<br>
That means that, for example, five values of type <code>int</code> can be declared as an array without having to declare 5 different variables (each with its own identifier). Instead, using an array, the five <code>int</code> values are stored in contiguous memory locations, and all five can be accessed using the same identifier, with the proper index.<br>
<br>
For example, an array containing 5 integer values of type <code>int</code> called <code>foo</code> could be represented as:<br>
<br>
<img src="arrays1.png" alt="">
  <br>
where each blank panel represents an element of the array. In this case, these are values of type <code>int</code>. These elements are numbered from 0 to 4, being 0 the first and 4 the last; In C++, the first element in an array is always numbered with a zero (not a one), no matter its length.<br>
<br>
Like a regular variable, an array must be declared before it is used. A typical declaration for an array in C++ is:<br>
<br>
<code>
type name [elements];<br>
</code>
<br>
where <code>type</code> is a valid type (such as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>...), <code>name</code> is a valid identifier and the <code>elements</code> field (which is always enclosed in square brackets <code>[]</code>), specifies the length of the array in terms of the number of elements.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the <code>foo</code> array, with five elements of type <code>int</code>, can be declared as:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> foo [5];</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: The <code>elements</code> field within square brackets <code>[]</code>, representing the number of elements in the array, must be a <i>constant expression</i>, since arrays are blocks of static memory whose size must be determined at compile time, before the program runs.<br>
