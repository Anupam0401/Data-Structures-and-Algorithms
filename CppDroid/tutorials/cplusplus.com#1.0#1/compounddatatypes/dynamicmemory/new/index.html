<h3>Operators new and new[]</h3>
Dynamic memory is allocated using operator <code>new</code>. <code>new</code> is followed by a data type specifier and, if a sequence of more than one element is required, the number of these within brackets <code>[]</code>. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the new block of memory allocated. Its syntax is: <br>
<br>
<code>
pointer = new type<br>
pointer = new type [number_of_elements]<br>
</code>
<br>
The first expression is used to allocate memory to contain one single element of type <code>type</code>. The second one is used to allocate a block (an array) of elements of type <code>type</code>, where <code>number_of_elements</code> is an integer value representing the amount of these. For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> * foo;
foo = <var>new</var> <var>int</var> [5];</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
In this case, the system dynamically allocates space for five elements of type <code>int</code> and returns a pointer to the first element of the sequence, which is assigned to <code>foo</code> (a pointer). Therefore, <code>foo</code> now points to a valid block of memory with space for five elements of type <code>int</code>.<br>

<br>
Here, <code>foo</code> is a pointer, and thus, the first element pointed to by <code>foo</code> can be accessed either with the expression <code>foo[0]</code> or the expression <code>*foo</code> (both are equivalent). The second element can be accessed either with <code>foo[1]</code> or <code>*(foo+1)</code>, and so on...<br>
<br>
There is a substantial difference between declaring a normal array and allocating dynamic memory for a block of memory using <code>new</code>. The most important difference is that the size of a regular array needs to be a <i>constant expression</i>, and thus its size has to be determined at the moment of designing the program, before it is run, whereas the dynamic memory allocation performed by <code>new</code> allows to assign memory during runtime using any variable value as size.<br>
<br>
The dynamic memory requested by our program is allocated by the system from the memory heap. However, computer memory is a limited resource, and it can be exhausted. Therefore, there are no guarantees that all requests to allocate memory using operator <code>new</code> are going to be granted by the system. <br>
<br>
C++ provides two standard mechanisms to check if the allocation was successful:<br>
<br>
One is by handling exceptions. Using this method, an exception of type <code>bad_alloc</code> is thrown when the allocation fails. Exceptions are a powerful C++ feature explained later in these tutorials. But for now, you should know that if this exception is thrown and it is not handled by a specific handler, the program execution is terminated.<br>
<br>
This exception method is the method used by default by <code>new</code>, and is the one used in a declaration like:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>foo = <var>new</var> <var>int</var> [5];  <cite>// if allocation fails, an exception is thrown  </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The other method is known as <code>nothrow</code>, and what happens when it is used is that when a memory allocation fails, instead of throwing a <code>bad_alloc</code> exception or terminating the program, the pointer returned by <code>new</code> is a <i>null pointer</i>, and the program continues its execution normally.<br>
<br>
This method can be specified by using a special object called <code>nothrow</code>, declared in header <code><a href="/&lt;new&gt;">&lt;new&gt;</a></code>, as argument for <code>new</code>:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>foo = <var>new</var> (nothrow) <var>int</var> [5]; </code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
In this case, if the allocation of this block of memory fails, the failure can be detected by checking if <code>foo</code> is a null pointer:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> * foo;
foo = <var>new</var> (nothrow) <var>int</var> [5];
<var>if</var> (foo == <var>nullptr</var>) {
  <cite>// error assigning memory. Take measures.</cite>
}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This <code>nothrow</code> method is likely to produce less efficient code than exceptions, since it implies explicitly checking the pointer value returned after each and every allocation. Therefore, the exception mechanism is generally preferred, at least for critical allocations. Still, most of the coming examples will use the <code>nothrow</code> mechanism due to its simplicity.<br>
