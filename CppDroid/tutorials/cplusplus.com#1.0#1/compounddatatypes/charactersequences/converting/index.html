<h3>Strings and null-terminated character sequences</h3>
Plain arrays with null-terminated sequences of characters are the typical types used in the C language to represent strings (that is why they are also known as <i>C-strings</i>). In C++, even though the standard library defines a specific type for strings (class <code><a href="/string">string</a></code>), still, plain arrays with null-terminated sequences of characters (C-strings) are a natural way of representing strings in the language; in fact, string literals still always produce null-terminated character sequences, and not <code>string</code> objects.<br>
<br>
In the standard library, both representations for strings (C-strings and library strings) coexist, and most functions requiring strings are overloaded to support both.<br>
<br>
For example, <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code> support null-terminated sequences directly, allowing them to be directly extracted from <code>cin</code> or inserted into <code>cout</code>, just like strings. For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="split"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>// strings and NTCS:</cite>
<dfn>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</dfn>
<dfn>#include &lt;string&gt;</dfn>
<var>using</var> <var>namespace</var> std;

<var>int</var> main ()
{
  <var>char</var> question1[] = <kbd>"What is your name? "</kbd>;
  string question2 = <kbd>"Where do you live? "</kbd>;
  <var>char</var> answer1 [80];
  string answer2;
  cout &lt;&lt; question1;
  cin &gt;&gt; answer1;
  cout &lt;&lt; question2;
  cin &gt;&gt; answer2;
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"Hello, "</kbd> &lt;&lt; answer1;
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>" from "</kbd> &lt;&lt; answer2 &lt;&lt; <kbd>"!\n"</kbd>;
  <var>return</var> 0;
}</code></pre></td>
<td class="output"><pre><samp>What is your name? Homer
Where do you live? Ancient Greece
Hello, Homer from Ancient Greece!</samp></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
In this example, both arrays of characters using null-terminated sequences and strings are used. They are quite interchangeable in their use together with <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code>, but there is a notable difference in their declarations: arrays have a fixed size that needs to be specified either implicit or explicitly when declared; <code>question1</code> has a size of exactly 20 characters (including the terminating null-characters) and <code>answer1</code> has a size of 80 characters; while strings are simply strings, no size is specified. This is due to the fact that strings have a dynamic size determined during runtime, while the size of arrays is determined on compilation, before the program runs.<br>
<br>
In any case, null-terminated character sequences and arrays are easily transformed from one another:<br>
<br>
Null-terminated character sequences can be transformed into strings implicitly, and strings can be transformed into null-terminated character sequences by using either of <code>string</Code>'s member functions <code>c_str</code> or <code>data</code>:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>char</var> myntcs[] = <kbd>"some text"</kbd>;
string mystring = myntcs;  <cite>// convert c-string to string</cite>
cout &lt;&lt; mystring;          <cite>// printed as a library string</cite>
cout &lt;&lt; mystring.c_str();  <cite>// printed as a c-string </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
(note: both <code>c_str</code> and <code>data</code> members of <code>string</code> are equivalent)<br>
