The <code>string</code> class has been briefly introduced in an earlier section. It is a very powerful class to handle and manipulate strings of characters. However, because strings are, in fact, sequences of characters, we can represent them also as plain arrays of elements of a character type.<br>
<br>
For example, the following array:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>char</var> foo [20];</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
is an array that can store up to 20 elements of type <code>char</code>. It can be represented as:<br>

  <br>
Therefore, this array has a capacity to store sequences of up to 20 characters. But this capacity does not need to be fully exhausted: the array can also accommodate shorter sequences. For example, at some point in a program, either the sequence <code>"Hello"</code> or the sequence <code>"Merry Christmas"</code> can be stored in <code>foo</code>, since both would fit in a sequence with a capacity for 20 characters.<br>
<br>
By convention, the end of strings represented in character sequences is signaled by a special character: the <i>null character</i>, whose literal value can be written as <code>'\0'</code> (backslash, zero).<br>
<br>
In this case, the array of 20 elements of type <code>char</code> called <code>foo</Code> can be represented storing the character sequences <code>"Hello"</code> and <code>"Merry Christmas"</code> as:<br>
<br>

<br>
Notice how after the content of the string itself, a null character (<code>'\0'</code>) has been added in order to indicate the end of the sequence. The panels in gray color represent <code>char</code> elements with undetermined values.<br>
