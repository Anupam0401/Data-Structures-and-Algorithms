<h3>Pointers and string literals</h3>
As pointed earlier, <i>string literals</i> are arrays containing null-terminated character sequences. In earlier sections, string literals have been used to be directly inserted into <code>cout</code>, to initialize strings and to initialize arrays of characters.<br>
<br>
But they can also be accessed directly. String literals are arrays of the proper array type to contain all its characters plus the terminating null-character, with each of the elements being of type <code>const char</code> (as literals, they can never be modified). For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>const</var> <var>char</var> * foo = <kbd>"hello"</kbd>; </code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This declares an array with the literal representation for <code>"hello"</code>, and then a pointer to its first element is assigned to <code>foo</code>. If we imagine that <code>"hello"</code> is stored at the memory locations that start at address 1702, we can represent the previous declaration as:<br>
<br>

  <br>
Note that here <code>foo</code> is a pointer and contains the value 1702, and not <code>'h'</code>, nor <code>"hello"</code>, although 1702 indeed is the address of both of these.<br>
<br>
The pointer <code>foo</code> points to a sequence of characters. And because pointers and arrays behave essentially in the same way in expressions, <code>foo</code> can be used to access the characters in the same way arrays of null-terminated character sequences are. For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>*(foo+4)
foo[4]</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Both expressions have a value of <code>'o'</code> (the fifth element of the array).<br>
