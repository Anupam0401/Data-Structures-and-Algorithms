<h3>Declaring pointers</h3>
Due to the ability of a pointer to directly refer to the value that it points to, a pointer has different properties when it points to a <code>char</code> than when it points to an <code>int</code> or a <code>float</code>. Once dereferenced, the type needs to be known. And for that, the declaration of a pointer needs to include the data type the pointer is going to point to.<br>
<br>
The declaration of pointers follows this syntax:<br>
<br>
<code>type * name;</code> <br>
<br>
where <code>type</code> is the data type pointed to by the pointer. This type is not the type of the pointer itself, but the type of the data the pointer points to. For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> * number;
<var>char</var> * character;
<var>double</var> * decimals;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
These are three declarations of pointers. Each one is intended to point to a different data type, but, in fact, all of them are pointers and all of them are likely going to occupy the same amount of space in memory (the size in memory of a pointer depends on the platform where the program runs). Nevertheless, the data to which they point to do not occupy the same amount of space nor are of the same type: the first one points to an <code>int</code>, the second one to a <code>char</code>, and the last one to a <code>double</code>. Therefore, although these three example variables are all of them pointers, they actually have different types: <code>int*</code>, <code>char*</code>, and <code>double*</code> respectively, depending on the type they point to.<br>
<br>
Note that the asterisk (<code>*</code>) used when declaring a pointer only means that it is a pointer (it is part of its type compound specifier), and should not be confused with the <i>dereference operator</i> seen a bit earlier, but which is also written with an asterisk (<code>*</code>). They are simply two different things represented with the same sign.<br>
<br>
Let's see an example on pointers:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="split"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>// my first pointer</cite>
<dfn>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</dfn>
<var>using</var> <var>namespace</var> std;

<var>int</var> main ()
{
  <var>int</var> firstvalue, secondvalue;
  <var>int</var> * mypointer;

  mypointer = &amp;firstvalue;
  *mypointer = 10;
  mypointer = &amp;secondvalue;
  *mypointer = 20;
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"firstvalue is "</kbd> &lt;&lt; firstvalue &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"secondvalue is "</kbd> &lt;&lt; secondvalue &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  <var>return</var> 0;
}</code></pre></td>
<td class="output"><pre><samp>firstvalue is 10
secondvalue is 20</samp></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Notice that even though neither <code>firstvalue</code> nor <code>secondvalue</code> are directly set any value in the program, both end up with a value set indirectly through the use of <code>mypointer</code>. This is how it happens:<br>
<br>
First, <code>mypointer</code> is assigned the address of firstvalue using the reference operator (<code>&</code>). Then, the value pointed to by <code>mypointer</code> is assigned a value of <code>10</code>. Because, at this moment, <code>mypointer</code> is pointing to the memory location of <code>firstvalue</code>, this in fact modifies the value of <code>firstvalue</code>.<br>
<br>
In order to demonstrate that a pointer may point to different variables during its lifetime in a program, the example repeats the process with <code>secondvalue</code> and that same pointer, <code>mypointer</code>.<br>
<br>
Here is an example a little bit more elaborated:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="split"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>// more pointers</cite>
<dfn>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</dfn>
<var>using</var> <var>namespace</var> std;

<var>int</var> main ()
{
  <var>int</var> firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;
  <var>int</var> * p1, * p2;

  p1 = &amp;firstvalue;  <cite>// p1 = address of firstvalue</cite>
  p2 = &amp;secondvalue; <cite>// p2 = address of secondvalue</cite>
  *p1 = 10;          <cite>// value pointed to by p1 = 10</cite>
  *p2 = *p1;         <cite>// value pointed to by p2 = value pointed by p1</cite>
  p1 = p2;           <cite>// p1 = p2 (value of pointer is copied)</cite>
  *p1 = 20;          <cite>// value pointed by p1 = 20</cite>
  
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"firstvalue is "</kbd> &lt;&lt; firstvalue &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"secondvalue is "</kbd> &lt;&lt; secondvalue &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  <var>return</var> 0;
}</code></pre></td>
<td class="output"><pre><samp>firstvalue is 10
secondvalue is 20</samp></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Each assignment operation includes a comment on how each line could be read: i.e., replacing ampersands (<code>&</code>) by "address of", and asterisks (<code>*</code>) by "value pointed to by".<br>
<br>
Notice that there are expressions with pointers <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, both with and without the <i>dereference operator</i> (<code>*</code>). The meaning of an expression using the <i>dereference operator</i> (*) is very different from one that does not. When this operator precedes the pointer name, the expression refers to the value being pointed, while when a pointer name appears without this operator, it refers to the value of the pointer itself (i.e., the address of what the pointer is pointing to).<br>
<br>
Another thing that may call your attention is the line: <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> * p1, * p2;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This declares the two pointers used in the previous example. But notice that there is an asterisk (<code>*</code>) for each pointer, in order for both to have type <code>int*</code> (pointer to <code>int</code>). This is required due to the precedence rules. Note that if, instead, the code was:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> * p1, p2;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
<code>p1</code> would indeed be of type <code>int*</code>, but <code>p2</code> would be of type <code>int</code>. Spaces do not matter at all for this purpose. But anyway, simply remembering to put one asterisk per pointer is enough for most pointer users interested in declaring multiple pointers per statement. Or even better: use a different statemet for each variable.<br>
