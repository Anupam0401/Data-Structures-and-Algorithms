<h3>Dereference operator (*)</h3>
As just seen, a variable which stores the address of another variable is called a <i>pointer</i>. Pointers are said to "point to" the variable whose address they store.<br>
<br>
An interesting property of pointers is that they can be used to access the variable they point to directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the <i>dereference operator</i> (<code>*</code>). The operator itself can be read as "value pointed to by".<br>
<br>
Therefore, following with the values of the previous example, the following statement: <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>baz = *foo;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This could be read as: "<code>baz</code> equal to value pointed to by <code>foo</code>", and the statement would actually assign the value <code>25</code> to <code>baz</code>, since <code>foo</code> is <code>1776</code>, and the value pointed to by <code>1776</code> (following the example above) would be <code>25</code>.<br>
<br>

<br>
It is important to clearly differentiate that <code>foo</code> refers to the value <code>1776</code>, while <code>*foo</code> (with an asterisk <code>*</code> preceding the identifier) refers to the value stored at address <code>1776</code>, which in this case is <code>25</code>. Notice the difference of including or not including the <i>dereference operator</i> (I have added an explanatory comment of how each of these two expressions could be read): <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>baz = foo;   <cite>// baz equal to foo (1776)</cite>
baz = *foo;  <cite>// baz equal to value pointed to by foo (25)  </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The reference and dereference operators are thus complementary:<br>
<ul>
<li><code>&</code> is the <i>reference operator</i>, and can be read as "address of"</li>
<li><code>*</code> is the <i>dereference operator</i>, and can be read as "value pointed to by"</li>
</ul>
<br>
Thus, they have sort of opposite meanings: A variable referenced with <code>&</code> can be dereferenced with <code>*</code>.<br>
<br>
Earlier, we performed the following two assignment operations:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>myvar = 25;
foo = &amp;myvar;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Right after these two statements, all of the following expressions would give true as result:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>myvar == 25
&amp;myvar == 1776
foo == 1776
*foo == 25</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The first expression is quite clear, considering that the assignment operation performed on <code>myvar</code> was <code>myvar=25</code>. The second one uses the reference operator (<code>&</code>), which returns the address of <code>myvar</code>, which we assumed it to have a value of <code>1776</code>. The third one is somewhat obvious, since the second expression was true and the assignment operation performed on <code>foo</code> was <code>foo=&myvar</code>. The fourth expression uses the <i>dereference operator</i> (<code>*</code>) that can be read as "value pointed to by", and the value pointed to by <code>foo</code> is indeed <code>25</code>.<br>
<br>
So, after all that, you may also infer that for as long as the address pointed by <code>foo</code> remains unchanged, the following expression will also be true: <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>*foo == myvar</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
