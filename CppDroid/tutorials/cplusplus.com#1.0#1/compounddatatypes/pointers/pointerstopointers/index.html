<h3>Pointers to pointers</h3>
C++ allows the use of pointers that point to pointers, that these, in its turn, point to data (or even to other pointers). The syntax simply requires an asterisk (<code>*</code>) for each level of indirection in the declaration of the pointer:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>char</var> a;
<var>char</var> * b;
<var>char</var> ** c;
a = <kbd>'z'</kbd>;
b = &amp;a;
c = &amp;b;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This, assuming the randomly chosen memory locations for each variable of <code>7230</code>, <code>8092</code>, and <code>10502</code>, could be represented as:<br>
<br>

  <br>
With the value of each variable represented inside its corresponding cell, and their respective addresses in memory represented by the value under them.<br>
 <br>
The new thing in this example is variable <code>c</code>, which is a pointer to a pointer, and can be used in three different levels of indirection, each one of them would correspond to a different value:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><code>c</code> is of type <code>char**</code> and a value of <code>8092</code></li>
<li><code>*c</code> is of type <code>char*</code> and a value of <code>7230</code></li>
<li><code>**c</code> is of type <code>char</code> and a value of <code>'z'</code></li>
</ul>
