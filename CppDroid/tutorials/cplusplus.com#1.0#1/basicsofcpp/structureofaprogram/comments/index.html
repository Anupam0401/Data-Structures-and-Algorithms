<h3>Comments</h3>
As noted above, comments do not affect the operation of the program; however,  they provide an important tool to document directly within the source code what the program does and how it operates.<br>
<br>
C++ supports two ways of commenting code:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>// line comment</cite>
<cite>/* block comment */</cite> </code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The first of them, known as <i>line comment</i>, discards everything from where the pair of slash signs (<code>//</code>) are found up to the end of that same line. The second one, known as <i>block comment</i>, discards everything between the <code>/*</code> characters and the first appearance of the <code>*/</code> characters, with the possibility of including multiple lines.<br>
<br>
Let's add comments to our second program: <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="split"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>/* my second program in C++
   with more comments */</cite>

<dfn>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</dfn>

<var>int</var> main ()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"Hello World! "</kbd>;     <cite>// prints Hello World!</cite>
  std::cout &lt;&lt; <kbd>"I'm a C++ program"</kbd>; <cite>// prints I'm a C++ program</cite>
}</code></pre></td>
<td class="output"><pre><samp>Hello World! I'm a C++ program</samp></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
If comments are included within the source code of a program without using the comment characters combinations <code>//</code>, <code>/*</code> or <code>*/</code>, the compiler takes them as if they were C++ expressions, most likely causing the compilation to fail with one, or several, error messages.<br>
