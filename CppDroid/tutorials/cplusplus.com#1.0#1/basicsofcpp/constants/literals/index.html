<h3>Literals</h3>
Literals are the most obvious kind of constants. They are used to express particular values within the source code of a program. We have already used some in previous chapters to give specific values to variables or to express messages we wanted our programs to print out, for example, when we wrote:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>a = 5;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The <code>5</code> in this piece of code was a <i>literal constant</i>.<br>
<br>
Literal constants can be classified into: integer, floating-point, characters, strings, Boolean, pointers, and user-defined literals.<br>
