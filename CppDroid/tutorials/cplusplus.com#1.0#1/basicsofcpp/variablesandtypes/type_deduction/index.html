<h3>Type deduction: auto and decltype</h3>
When a new variable is initialized, the compiler can figure out what the type of the variable is automatically by the initializer. For this, it suffices to use <code>auto</code> as the type specifier for the variable:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> foo = 0;
<var>auto</var> bar = foo;  <cite>// the same as: int bar = foo; </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Here, <code>bar</code> is declared as having an <code>auto</code> type; therefore, the type of <code>bar</code> is the type of the value used to initialize it: in this case it uses the type of <code>foo</code>, which is <code>int</code>.<br>
<br>
Variables that are not initialized can also make use of type deduction with the <code>decltype</code> specifier:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> foo = 0;
<var>decltype</var>(foo) bar;  <cite>// the same as: int bar; </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Here, <code>bar</code> is declared as having the same type as <code>foo</code>.<br>
<br>
<code>auto</code> and <code>decltype</code> are powerful features recently added to the language. But the type deduction features they introduce are meant to be used either when the type cannot be obtained by other means or when using it improves code readability. The two examples above were likely neither of these use cases. In fact they probably decreased readability, since, when reading the code, one has to search for the type of <code>foo</code> to actually know the type of <code>bar</code>.<br>
