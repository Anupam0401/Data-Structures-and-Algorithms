<h3>Comma operator ( , )</h3>
The comma operator (<code>,</code>) is used to separate two or more expressions that are included where only one expression is expected. When the set of expressions has to be evaluated for a value, only the right-most expression is considered.<br>
<br>
For example, the following code:<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>a = (b=3, b+2);</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
would first assign the value 3 to <code>b</code>, and then assign <code>b+2</code> to variable <code>a</code>. So, at the end, variable <code>a</code> would contain the value 5 while variable <code>b</code> would contain value 3.<br>
