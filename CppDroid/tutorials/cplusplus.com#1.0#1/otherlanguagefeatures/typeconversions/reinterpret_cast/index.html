<h3>reinterpret_cast</h3>
<code>reinterpret_cast</code> converts any pointer type to any other pointer type, even of unrelated classes. The operation result is a simple binary copy of the value from one pointer to the other. All pointer conversions are allowed: neither the content pointed nor the pointer type itself is checked.<br>
<br>
It can also cast pointers to or from integer types. The format in which this integer value represents a pointer is platform-specific. The only guarantee is that a pointer cast to an integer type large enough to fully contain it (such as <code><a href="/intptr_t">intptr_t</a></code>), is guaranteed to be able to be cast back to a valid pointer.<br>
<br>
The conversions that can be performed by <code>reinterpret_cast</code> but not by <code>static_cast</code> are low-level operations based on reinterpreting the binary representations of the types, which on most cases results in code which is system-specific, and thus non-portable. For example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>class</var> A { <cite>/* ... */</cite> };
<var>class</var> B { <cite>/* ... */</cite> };
A * a = <var>new</var> A;
B * b = <var>reinterpret_cast</var>&lt;B*&gt;(a);</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This code compiles, although it does not make much sense, since now <code>b</code> points to an object of a totally unrelated and likely incompatible class. Dereferencing <code>b</code> is unsafe.<br>
