<h3>Pragma directive (#pragma)</h3>
This directive is used to specify diverse options to the compiler. These options are specific for the platform and the compiler you use. Consult the manual or the reference of your compiler for more information on the possible parameters that you can define with <code>#pragma</code>.<br>
<br>
If the compiler does not support a specific argument for <code>#pragma</code>, it is ignored - no syntax error is generated.<br>
