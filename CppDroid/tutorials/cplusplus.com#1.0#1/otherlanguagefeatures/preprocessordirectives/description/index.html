Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (<code>#</code>). These lines are not program statements but directives for the <i>preprocessor</i>. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements.<br>
<br>
These <i>preprocessor directives</i> extend only across a single line of code. As soon as a newline character is found, the preprocessor directive is ends. No semicolon (<code>;</code>) is expected at the end of a preprocessor directive. The only way a preprocessor directive can extend through more than one line is by preceding the newline character at the end of the line by a backslash (<code>\</code>).<br>
