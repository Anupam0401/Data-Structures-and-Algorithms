<h3>Source file inclusion (#include)</h3>
This directive has been used assiduously in other sections of this tutorial. When the preprocessor finds an <code>#include</code> directive it replaces it by the entire content of the specified header or file. There are two ways to use <code>#include</code>: <br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><dfn>#include &lt;header&gt;</dfn>
<dfn>#include "file" </dfn></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
In the first case, a <i>header</i> is specified between angle-brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. This is used to include headers provided by the implementation, such as the headers that compose the standard library (<code>iostream</code>, <code>string</code>,...). Whether the headers are actually files or exist in some other form is <i>implementation-defined</i>, but in any case they shall be properly included with this directive.<br>
<br>
The syntax used in the second <code>#include</code> uses quotes, and includes a <i>file</i>. The <i>file</i> is searched for in an <i>implementation-defined</i> manner, which generally includes the current path. In the case that the file is not found, the compiler interprets the directive as a <i>header</i> inclusion, just as if the quotes (<code>""</code>) were replaced by angle-brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>).<br>
