The essential tools needed to follow these tutorials are a computer and a compiler toolchain able to compile C++ code and build the programs to run on it.<br>
<br>
C++ is a language that has evolved much over the years, and these tutorials explain many features added recently to the language. Therefore, in order to properly follow the tutorials, a recent compiler is needed. It shall support (even if only partially) the features introduced by the 2011 standard.<br>
<br>
Many compiler vendors support the new features at different degrees. See the bottom of this page for some compilers that are known to support the features needed. Some of them are free!<br>
<br>
If for some reason, you need to use some older compiler, you can access an older version of these tutorials <a href="/doc/oldtutorial/">here</a> (no longer updated).<br>
