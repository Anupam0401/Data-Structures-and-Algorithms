<h3>Console programs</h3>
Console programs are programs that use text to communicate with the user and the environment, such as printing text to the screen or reading input from a keyboard.<br>
<br>
Console programs are easy to interact with, and generally have a predictable behavior that is identical across all platforms. They are also simple to implement and thus are very useful to learn the basics of a programming language: The examples in these tutorials are all console programs.<br>
<br>
The way to compile console programs depends on the particular tool you are using.<br>
<br>
The easiest way for beginners to compile C++ programs is by using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE generally integrates several development tools, including a text editor and tools to compile programs directly from it.<br>
<br>
Here you have instructions on how to compile and run console programs using different free Integrated Development Interfaces (IDEs):<br>

If you happen to have a Linux or Mac environment with development features, you should be able to compile any of the examples directly from a terminal just by including C++11 flags in the command for the compiler:<br>
