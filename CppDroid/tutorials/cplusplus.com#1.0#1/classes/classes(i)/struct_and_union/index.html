<h3>Classes defined with struct and union</h3>
Classes can be defined not only with keyword <code>class</code>, but also with keywords <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code>.<br>
<br>
The keyword <code>struct</code>, generally used to declared plain data structures, can also be used to declare classes that have member functions, with the same syntax as with keyword <code>class</code>. The only difference between both is that members of classes declared with the keyword <code>struct</code> have <code>public</code> access by default, while members of classes declared with the keyword <code>class</code> have <code>private</code> access by default. For all other purposes both keywords are equivalent in this context.<br>
<br>
Conversely, the concept of <i>unions</i> is different from that of classes declared with <code>struct</code> and <code>class</Code>, since unions only store one data member at a time, but nevertheless they are also classes and can thus also hold member functions. The default access in union classes is <code>public</code>.<br>
