<h3>Copy assignment</h3>
Objects are not only copied on construction, when they are initialized: They can also be copied on any assignment operation. See the difference:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>MyClass foo;
MyClass bar (foo);       <cite>// object initialization: copy constructor called</cite>
MyClass baz = foo;       <cite>// object initialization: copy constructor called</cite>
foo = bar;               <cite>// object already initialized: copy assignment called </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Note that <code>bar</code> is initialized on construction using an <i>equal sign</i>, but this is not an assignment operation! (although it may look like one): The declaration of an object is not an assignment operation, it is just another of the syntaxes to call single-argument constructors.<br>
<br>
The assignment on <code>foo</code> is an assignment operation. No object is being declared here, but an operation is being performed on an existing object; <code>foo</code>.<br>
<br>
The <i>copy assignment operator</i> is an overload of <code>operator=</code> which takes a <i>value</i> or <i>reference</i> of the class itself as parameter. The return value is generally a reference to <code>*this</code> (although this is not required). For example, for a class <code>MyClass</code>, the <i>copy assignment</i> may have the following signature:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>MyClass&amp; <var>operator</var>= (<var>const</var> MyClass&amp;);</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
The <i>copy assignment operator</i> is also a <i>special function</i> and is also defined implicitly if a class has no custom <i>copy</i> nor <i>move</i> assignments (nor move constructor) defined.<br>
<br>
But again, the <i>implicit</i> version performs a <i>shallow copy</i> which is suitable for many classes, but not for classes with pointers to objects they handle its storage, as is the case in <code>Example5</code>. In this case, not only the class incurs the risk of deleting the pointed object twice, but the assignment creates memory leaks by not deleting the object pointed by the object before the assignment. These issues could be solved with a <i>copy assignment</i> that deletes the previous object and performs a <i>deep copy</i>:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>Example5&amp; <var>operator</var>= (<var>const</var> Example5&amp; x) {
  <var>delete</var> ptr;                      <cite>// delete currently pointed string</cite>
  ptr = <var>new</var> string (x.content());  <cite>// allocate space for new string, and copy</cite>
  <var>return</var> *<var>this</var>;
}
</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Or even better, since its <code>string</code> member is not constant, it could re-utilize the same <code>string</code> object:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>Example5&amp; <var>operator</var>= (<var>const</var> Example5&amp; x) {
  *ptr = x.content();
  <var>return</var> *<var>this</var>;
}</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
