<h3>Inheritance between classes</h3>
Classes in C++ can be extended, creating new classes which retain characteristics of the base class. This process, known as inheritance, involves a <i>base class</i> and a <i>derived class</i>: The <i>derived class</i> inherits the members of the <i>base class</i>, on top of which it can adds its own members.<br>
<br>
For example, let's imagine a series of classes to describe two kinds of polygons: rectangles and triangles. These two polygons have certain common properties, such as the values needed to calculate their areas: they both can be described simply with a height and a width (or base).<br>
<br>
This could be represented in the world of classes with a class <code>Polygon</code> from which we would derive the two other ones: <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code>:<br>
<br>

<br>
The <code>Polygon</code> class would contain members that are common for both types of polygon. In our case: <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. And <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code> would be its derived classes, with specific features that are different from one type of polygon to the other.<br>
<br>
Classes that are derived from others inherit all the accessible members of the base class. That means that if a base class includes a member <code>A</code> and we derive a class from it with another member called <code>B</code>, the derived class will contain both member <code>A</code> and member <code>B</code>.<br>
<br>
The inheritance relationship of two classes is declared in the derived class. Derived classes definitions use the following syntax:<br>
<br>
<code>
class derived_class_name: public base_class_name<br>
{ /*...*/ };<br>
</code>
<br>
Where <code>derived_class_name</code> is the name of the derived class and <code>base_class_name</code> is the name of the class on which it is based. The <code>public</code> access specifier may be replaced by any one of the other access specifiers (<code>protected</code> or <code>private</code>). This access specifier limits the most accessible level for the members inherited from the base class: The members with a more accessible level are inherited with this level instead, while the members with an equal or more restrictive access level keep their restrictive level in the derived class.<br>

<br>
<br>
The objects of the classes <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code> each contain members inherited from <code>Polygon</code>. These are: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> and <code>set_values</code>.<br>
<br>
The <code>protected</code> access specifier used in class <code>Polygon</code> is similar to <code>private</code>. Its only difference occurs in fact with inheritance: When a class inherits another one, the members of the derived class can access the protected members inherited from the base class, but not its private members.<br>
<br>
By declaring <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> as <code>protected</code> instead of <code>private</code>, these members are also accessible from the derived classes <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code>, instead of just from members of <code>Polygon</code>. If they were public, they could be access just from anywhere.<br>
 <br>
We can summarize the different access types according to which functions can access them in the following way: <br>
<br>
<table class="boxed">
<tr><th>Access</th><th><code>public</code></th><th><code>protected</code></th><th><code>private</code></th></tr>
<tr><td>members of the same class</td><td class="yes">yes</td><td class="yes">yes</td><td class="yes">yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>members of derived class</td><td class="yes">yes</td><td class="yes">yes</td><td class="no">no</td></tr>
<tr><td>not members</td><td class="yes">yes</td><td class="no">no</td><td class="no">no</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
Where "not members" represents any access from outside the class, such as from <code>main</code>, from another class or from a function.<br>
<br>
In the example above, the members inherited by <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Triangle</code> have the same access permissions as they had in their base class <code>Polygon</code>:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>Polygon::width           <cite>// protected access</cite>
Rectangle::width         <cite>// protected access</cite>

Polygon::set_values()    <cite>// public access</cite>
Rectangle::set_values()  <cite>// public access  </cite></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This is because the inheritance relation has been declared using the <code>public</Code> keyword on each of the derived classes:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>class</var> Rectangle: <var>public</var> Polygon { <cite>/* ... */</cite> }</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This <code>public</code> keyword after the colon (<code>:</code>) denotes the most accessible level the members inherited from the class that follows it (in this case <code>Polygon</code>) will have from the derived class (in this case <code>Rectangle</code>). Since <code>public</code> is the most accessible level, by specifying this keyword the derived class will inherit all the members with the same levels they had in the base class.<br>
<br>
With <code>protected</code>, all public members of the base class are inherited as <code>protected</code> in the derived class. Conversely, if the most restricting access level is specified (<code>private</code>), all the base class members are inherited as <code>private</code> and thus cannot be accessed from the derived class.<br>
<br>
For example, if daughter were a class derived from mother that we defined as:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>class</var> Daughter: <var>protected</var> Mother;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
This would set <code>protected</code> as the less restrictive access level for the members of <code>Daughter</code> that it inherited from mother. That is, all members that were <code>public</code> in <code>Mother</code> would become <code>protected</code> in <code>Daughter</code>. Of course, this would not restrict <code>Daughter</code> from declaring its own public members. That <i>less restrictive access level</i> is only set for the members inherited from <code>Mother</code>.<br>
<br>
If no access level is specified for the inheritance, the compiler assumes private for classes declared with keyword <code>class</code> and public for those declared with <code>struct</code>.<br>
