<h3>Static members</h3>
A class can contain static members, either data or functions.<br>
<br>
A static data member of a class is also known as a "class variable", because there is only one common variable for all the objects of that same class, sharing the same value: i.e., its value is not different from one object of this class to another.<br>
<br>
For example, it may be used for a variable within a class that can contain a counter with the number of objects of that class that are currently allocated, as in the following example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="split"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><cite>// static members in classes</cite>
<dfn>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</dfn>
<var>using</var> <var>namespace</var> std;

<var>class</var> Dummy {
  <var>public</var>:
    <var>static</var> <var>int</var> n;
    Dummy () { n++; };
    ~Dummy () { n--; };
};

<var>int</var> Dummy::n=0;

<var>int</var> main () {
  Dummy a;
  Dummy b[5];
  Dummy * c = <var>new</var> Dummy;
  cout &lt;&lt; a.n &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  <var>delete</var> c;
  cout &lt;&lt; Dummy::n &lt;&lt; <kbd>'\n'</kbd>;
  <var>return</var> 0;
}</code></pre></td>
<td class="output"><pre><samp>7
6</samp></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
In fact, static members have the same properties as non-member variables but they enjoy class scope. For that reason, and to avoid them to be declared several times, they cannot be initialized directly in the class, but need to be initialized somewhere outside it. As in the previous example:<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code><var>int</var> Dummy::n=0;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
Because it is a common variable value for all the objects of the same class, it can be referred to as a member of any object of that class or even directly by the class name (of course this is only valid for static members):<br>
<br>
<div class="auto"><table class="snippet"><tr><td class="rownum"><pre><code>1<br>2<br></code></pre></td>
<td class="source"><pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; a.n;
cout &lt;&lt; Dummy::n;</code></pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br>
<br>
These two calls above are referring to the same variable: the static variable <code>n</Code> within class <code>Dummy</code> shared by all objects of this class.<br>
<br>
Again, it is just like a non-member variable, but with a name that requires to be accessed like a member of a class (or an object).<br>
<br>
Classes can also have static member functions. These represent the same: members of a class that are common to all object of that class, acting exactly as non-member functions but being accessed like members of the class. Because they are like non-member functions, they cannot access non-static members of the class (neither member variables nor member functions). They neither can use the keyword <code>this</code>.<br>
