This C program has been used to implement Red Black Trees.

The user can change the data inputted initially to insert and delete in the input.txt file
the given values are in the order as : number of nodes to insert
				       data of the nodes to insert
				       number of nodes to delete
				       data of the node to be deleted
				       two numbers between which the inorder printing is to take place
					 
It is able to perform the below listed operations on a Red Black Tree:-
	1.Insert a node in the tree and retain the properties of a Red Black Tree.
	2.Delete a node from the existing Red Black Tree and retain uts Red Black properties.
	3.Find the number of leaves of the tree.
	4.Find the height of the tree.
	5.Print the data of the nodes within a given interval [a,b].

#By default, the data of the null nodes in T.nil are taken as zero.
#The data memebers are to be read from a file named input.txt attached along with the c program file.
#The user can furthur proceed to perform these operations while running the program itself after these things are completed.
#The leaf nodes are those real nodes created by the user with no child. 

***The user can provide repeated numbers in the insert.txt before insertion, the program automatically rejects the repeating elements
   and also provide a number not present in the tree for deletion.
