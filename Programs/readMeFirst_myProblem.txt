Please read this text first before moving to run the application.

I was unable to generate trigger in my institute email-ID because I practiced to create many triggers earlier after making spreadsheets and now I am not able to do so probably because the limit has exceeded.
I was truly unaware of this fact about limitting triggers before it actually happened. So, I went on to doing my assignment in other email-ID and I thought I would share that on my institute email-ID after completing it there.
But, when I shared that(spreadsheet and google form) , I was unable to provide owner access because domain of both email-IDs are different and hence, I am not getting move to option for those files in my institute email-ID. 

As of now , I have submitted my readMe_CS100Round2.txt file, appCode.txt(code.gs) file and built-in functions.pdf file for those working files.
But, since I am not able to upload it here(this shared with me folder) so, I have recreated those google forms and spreadsheet using my institute email-ID but, without trigger in my app script code and also added them in the folder.

It is my humble request to you to:
1. copy the code from appCode.txt and paste it in my spreadsheet's script Editor.
2. Add trigger by changing the 'event type' to 'On form submit' before using it, save it and then run the script Editor.

After adding trigger, it works same as I created it actually and now you can view and follow the readMe_CS100Round2.txt to check furthur working of my app.
Please forgive me for this inconvenience caused to you.
