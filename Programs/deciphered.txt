Beforehead , I just wanted to learn about cyber 
security and what we call as 'hacking'
but didn't actually give it a start and actually
don't know much about it.
 
But, after I participated in the CTF competition ,
 I found it very interesting and I got to
 learn explore many new things . So, I think 
afer joining this club , I will have a
wonderful opportunity to learn and explore the 
field of cyber security and other fields I am 
still not aware of!!
 

the members of de.ci.phe.red LAB published their 
first academic paper in Cryptanalysis between 
late 2019 to early 2020. Currently, de.ci.phe.red
 LAB is working on topics in Core Cryptography, 
RFID Security, Embedded Device Security. 
We are actively looking for new topics in 
cybersecurity to work on and are hence open to 
having research collaborations with other 
academic institutes on topics from cybersecurity 
including but not limited to the above.
