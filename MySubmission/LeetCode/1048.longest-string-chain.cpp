 * [1048] Longest String Chain
 */

// @lc code=start

// You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

// wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

// For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
// A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

// Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

class Solution {
public:
    //comparator for sorting the words based on its length
    static bool compare(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        return s1.length() < s2.length();
    }

    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), compare);
        unordered_map<string, int> dp;
        int res = 0;
        for (string w : words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                string pre = w.substr(0, i) + w.substr(i + 1);
                dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp.find(pre) == dp.end() ? 1 : dp[pre] + 1);
            }
            res = max(res, dp[w]);
        }
        return res;
    }
