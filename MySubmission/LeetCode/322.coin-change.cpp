// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
