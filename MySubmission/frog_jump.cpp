// Problem Statement
// There is a frog on the 1st step of an N stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the Nth stair. HEIGHT[i] is the height of the (i+1)th stair.If Frog jumps from ith to jth stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by |HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] |.In the Frog is on ith staircase, he can jump either to (i+1)th stair or to (i+2)th stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from 1st stair to Nth stair.
