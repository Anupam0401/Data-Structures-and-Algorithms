# With her LAMBCHOP doomsday device finished, Commander Lambda is preparing for her debut on the galactic stage - but in order to make a grand entrance,
# she needs a grand staircase! As her personal assistant, you've been tasked with figuring out how to build the best staircase EVER.

# Lambda has given you an overview of the types of bricks available, plus a budget. You can buy different amounts of the different types of bricks (for
# example, 3 little pink bricks, or 5 blue lace bricks). Commander Lambda wants to know how many different types of staircases can be built with each
# amount of bricks, so she can pick the one with the most options.

# Each type of staircase should consist of 2 or more steps.  No two steps are allowed to be at the same height - each step must be lower than the previous
# one. All steps must contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified as the total amount of bricks that make up that step.
# For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and the second step having a
# height of 1: (# indicates a brick)

# #
# ##
# 21

# When N = 4, you still only have 1 staircase choice:

# #
# #
# ##
# 31

# But when N = 5, there are two ways you can build a staircase from the given bricks. The two staircases can have heights (4, 1) or (3, 2), as shown
# below:

# #
# #
# #
# ##
# 41

# #
# ##
# ##
# 32

# Write a function called answer(n) that takes a positive integer n and returns the number of different staircases that can be built from exactly n
# bricks. n will always be at least 3 (so you can have a staircase at all), but no more than 200, because Commander Lambda's not made of money!


def solution(n):
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 2)] for _ in range(n + 2)]
    return staircase(1, n, dp) - 1

def staircase(h, l, dp):
    if dp[h][l] != 0:
        return dp[h][l]
    if l == 0:
        return 1
    if l < h:
        return 0
    dp[h][l] = staircase(h + 1, l - h, dp) + staircase(h + 1, l, dp)
    return dp[h][l]
