The formula for stack permutation in general is C(2*n,n)/(n+1); if n is the number of digits
The user provides the no. of digits and then the number itself.

This works for  all possible finite integer values.
This program implements queue as well as stack concepts of dta structure and a special stackpermutation() to find the permutation.
